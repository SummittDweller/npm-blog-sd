Wow, this post is long overdue.  

For as long as I can remember I've been looking for, or building and using, a workflow that would let me create quick and simple `microposts` for this blog using my iPhone.  I want that workflow to automatically record my location (in the form of a city/town reference) and date/time.  With the help of my daughter, Mackenzie, I've had workflows that used `Working Copy` and iOS `Shortcuts` to get this done, but I never really understood the entire process and over time it broke down and I was unable to repair it.  It's time to revisit those pieces and I'm going to follow, and document here, the steps and components presented in [Post to Eleventy from iOS with Drafts, Shortcuts and Working Copy](https://florian.ec/blog/post-to-eleventy-ios-drafts-shortcuts-working-copy/). The only change I anticipate will be pointing the workflow at this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) blog rather than an Eleventy one, and those differences should be minimal and manageable.
