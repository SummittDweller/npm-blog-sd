Just moved into room 71-19 (7th floor) of the Inpatient Rehab Unit (IRU) at Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids.

For anyone coming to visit be advised that you enter the parking ramp on 10th Street but the intersection at 10th Street and 8th Ave. SE south of the hospital, is closed, you must come in on 10th Street from the north.
