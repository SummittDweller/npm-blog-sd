So I went home last night and got some rest.  When I returned this morning about 30 minutes ago Chris was on the phone talking with a representative from Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids and we believe Mackenzie is checking out of here today and we will be transporting her to the rehab facility at Mercy CR.

She is currently out running laps with her mother around the neuro ward.  I took her for a lap and a half before this update and she is moving even better and faster than yesterday. She did have some headaches overnight but they've got those under control here.  I think she's feeling pretty good this morning, still struggling with some speech as the words are on the tip of her tongue but she can't always get them out as quickly as she would like.

I anticipate a busy morning and I'll let everyone know what's up as soon as we learn more.
