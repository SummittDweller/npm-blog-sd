I'm in the car and headed back to CR, and I haven't seen Mackenzie in more than 24 hours so I'm not sure what to tell you here but I thought maybe it's time for a little fun and humor. I'm also capturing this because I don't wanna forget it down the road.

A few days ago when we checked into Mercy Cedar Rapids, our caseworker came in collecting information, mostly from me, but also from Mackenzie. She had lots of questions.

One of them was "are you single or married?" Mackenzie was able to answer that one while sitting up in her bed. She turned her head to the side, flipped her hair back and announced "I'm single." The caseworker didn't see it, but Morgan and I were just cracking up. So since she missed it, Mackenzie repeated it for Kim, our caseworker, and we were all in stitches.

Just a little story to lighten your day, it certainly lightened mine.
