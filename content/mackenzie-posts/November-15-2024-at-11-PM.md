Mackenzie is still resting comfortably in the ICU and they are looking for a bed for her so we hope to be out of there in the next few hours. She still has her feeding tube but she's eating a little better so they think that might come out today.

She continues to make slow progress and has been up and walking a little, but still has some difficulty with her right hand and speech. 

We don't yet know how long she will remain here in the hospital, but they are already making plans for in-patient therapy at a regional center for a week or two following discharge.  We hope she has therapy in Cedar Rapids at Mercy, but Ames and Waterloo are also possibilities.

I'll post more when we get an update.
