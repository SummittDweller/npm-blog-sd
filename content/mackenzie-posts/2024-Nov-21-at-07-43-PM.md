Not much to update here, but I wanted to post and add Kayla to the updates thread.  

Mackenzie had a good nap after therapy and she's perked up a little.  She still hates that she can't go home tomorrow, but I think she is coming to grips with that.  I got an OK to bring some of her OLD video games back with me tomorrow so she hopefully won't get too bored this weekend when therapy slows down a bit.  

She can't play anything too complex or online interactive stuff to start, but they think some of her older single-player games will be good for her.

Just to repeat the key info... discharge should happen Tuesday morning around 10 or 11 AM.   Before she comes home we should have an outpatient ST and OT schedule for her with appointments at GRMC Physical Therapy in Grinnell.  I'm not sure how many days per week or how many hours at this point.
