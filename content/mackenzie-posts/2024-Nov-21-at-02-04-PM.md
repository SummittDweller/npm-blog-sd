Our girl is not too happy this afternoon.  Her care team would like her to stay here until Tuesday morning, November 24, so she can receive very intensive speech and occupational therapy for a few more days before moving to outpatient therapy.  She is still making great progress but was really hoping to go home before this weekend when things move a little slower around here.  I honestly think sheâ€™s more bored than frustrated right now.  

She will have speech therapy on Saturday but we're not sure at all about Sunday, and one of the therapists suggested she won't have any sessions on Sunday afternoon. So, I'm going to ask if we can bring her home for a while to spend some time there on Sunday, and bring her back to stay here Sunday evening until she is discharged on Tuesday.

She believes, and I do too, that when she had the opportunity to chat with her friends online from home, it helped her a great deal after the first stroke.  I will see if I can make that argument with her caseworker and her therapy team to try and get a little time away at home this weekend.

Whatever the case, I'm going to try and get away for a visit to work in Grinnell on Saturday, before returning here Saturday evening or Sunday morning.

As always, thank you for your support, prayers, and understanding. Take care.
