She had a restful day in ICU, is sitting up a little more, eating a little soft food, and is speaking just a little.  Her left/right functions are nearly back to normal. Speech therapy was here and pleased that she can swallow again.  Feeding tube is still in but she is clearly looking forward to getting that out later.

She just took the TV remote from me and is channel surfing again!

Chris is staying the night in ICU (the family room has ample space and some areas where people can sleep) but I'm leaving to go home soon to take care of some things at home before I return in the morning.
