Sorry for the late update, been a busy morning here.  Mackenzie continues to rest comfortably for the most part although her feeding tube is still in and that thing is driving her up the wall.  She needs to get one more meal in her today before they will feel safe enough to remove that.  

She's getting up to use the bathroom, brush her teeth, comb her hair, took a shower, all the things we take for granted. She's still struggling with her speech and processing numbers, but you can tell the information is all there. It's just getting it out, and communicating that is tricky.

Aunt Deb and Uncle Doug brought some flashcards and learning toys for her to try and exercise her brain a little.  She continues to make some progress but is also getting frustrated and a little depressed at times so we are taking it slow and easy.

Hopefully the feeding tube will come out later today and there's been talk that she might come home and have outpatient therapy appointments rather than going to inpatient therapy, we just don't know yet. If she does have inpatient therapy it will be at Mercy Hospital in Cedar Rapids where we are told one of us can stay with her overnight, much like what we've been doing here so far.

Thank you for your thoughts and prayers.
