Not much has changed with Mackenzie since the last update a couple of hours ago, but we did receive word that she will be admitted to rehabilitative care at a Mercy intensive therapy facility in Cedar Rapids, probably early next week.

Mackenzie's uncle had therapy there after his stroke 4 years ago and that went well. The facility is probably the most convenient for family members given the other choices we had as well.

Apologies once again for the "template " updates. To be honest, I'm trying some new software here and so far it's worked nicely.  However, if you would like me to remove you from this conversation just say the word. I don't want to bother anybody unnecessarily.

Thank you for all your support and thoughts for Mackenzie. Take care.
